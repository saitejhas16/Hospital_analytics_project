# üè• Hospital Resource Utilization Analytics

## üìå Project Overview
This project is a **data-driven hospital analytics solution** designed to monitor, analyze, and optimize the use of hospital resources.  
Built using **MySQL, Power BI, and DAX**, the system provides real-time dashboards and detailed reports on **patient inflow/outflow, bed occupancy, staff allocation, and equipment availability**.  

The aim is to help hospital administrators make **faster, evidence-based decisions** and ensure resources are allocated efficiently.

## üöÄ Tech Stack
- **Database**: MySQL (relational schema + sample data)  
- **Visualization**: Power BI (interactive dashboards + reports)  
- **DAX**: Custom KPIs and calculated measures  
- **Connector**: MySQL ODBC driver

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema
The database `hospital_resource_db` includes:  
- **Patients** ‚Üí demographics, diagnosis, condition status  
- **Departments** ‚Üí hospital departments & head doctors  
- **Beds** ‚Üí occupancy and type of bed (ICU, General, Emergency)  
- **Staff** ‚Üí doctors, nurses, technicians, shifts, availability  
- **Admissions** ‚Üí admission & discharge records  
- **Resource_Utilization** ‚Üí daily inflow, outflow, staff counts  
- **Equipment** ‚Üí units, availability, and maintenance status  

üëâ See [`hospital_resource_seed.sql`](hospital_resource_seed.sql) for schema + seed data.

## üìä Dashboard Overview

### üîπ KPIs
- **Current Inpatients**  
- **Average Length of Stay (LOS)**  
- **Bed Occupancy %**  
- **Staff Availability %**  
- **Equipment Availability %**  
- **Critical Patients Count**  

### üîπ Visuals
- **Line Chart** ‚Üí Patient inflow vs outflow trend  
- **Donut Chart** ‚Üí Patient distribution by department  
- **Bar Chart** ‚Üí Reasons for admission (heart attack, pregnancy, diabetes, etc.)  
- **Matrix** ‚Üí Bed occupancy vs staff availability by department  
- **Funnel Chart** ‚Üí Patient journey (Admissions ‚Üí Diagnosed ‚Üí Critical ‚Üí Recovering ‚Üí Stable ‚Üí Discharged)  
- **Gauges** ‚Üí Bed occupancy %, Staff availability %, Equipment availability %  
- **Slicers** ‚Üí Date, Department, Bed Type, Staff Role, Patient Condition

## üìë Detailed Reports

### 1. **Patients Data Report**
- Patient demographics (age group distribution)  
- Patient condition status split (Critical / Recovering / Stable)  
- Diseases by age group  
- Average LOS = **5.5 days**  

### 2. **Staff Data Report**
- Staff availability status (Available, Occupied, On Leave)  
- Staff distribution by role (Doctors, Nurses, Admin, Technicians)  
- Shift-wise allocation  

### 3. **Equipment Data Report**
- Total vs available equipment units  
- Maintenance status breakdown (Operational vs Under Maintenance)  
- Equipment availability by department  

### 4. **Hospital Operations Report**
- Patient inflow/outflow trend  
- Department-wise occupancy %  
- Department-wise staff availability %  
- Equipment availability %

## üèÜ Key Insights
- Bed occupancy varied between **25%‚Äì75%** across departments.  
- Equipment availability maintained at **86.8% overall**.  
- Average hospital stay = **5.5 days**.  
- Staff shortages in certain departments (as low as 20% availability).  
- Funnel showed patient drop-off from **Admissions ‚Üí Diagnosed ‚Üí Stable/Discharged**.  

---

## ‚ú® Future Improvements
- Integrate **Python predictive model** (ARIMA/Prophet) for admissions forecasting.  
- Automate daily refresh in **Power BI Service**.  
- Add real-time **alerts** for critical metrics (e.g., bed occupancy > 90%).
